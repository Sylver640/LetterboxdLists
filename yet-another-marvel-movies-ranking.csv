2022-05-06,Yet Another Marvel Movies Ranking,,https://boxd.it/gtC3g,"Finally! I decided to rank every film based in Marvel Comics characters, from that weird 1970's Dr. Strange movie and beyond. The movies ranked here will be just the ones from <a href=https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1--a0tKrRpUWyJyLgLHxHjg7ac1doHkuYQRpqLlW99pY/edit#gid=0> this list</a> here. I will not consider any movie is really a special from an already existing show, like those from ""The Incredible Hulk"".

As always, I will update as I watch them. And yes, I've already watched most of them, but I like to rank it fresh, you know?"
